Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Physics at UC Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/) and in the [Lawrence Berkeley Bational Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) working with [Prof. Feng Wang](https://physics.berkeley.edu/research-faculty/ultrafast-nano-optics-group). I am interested in the light-matter interactions and the electrical transport in condensed matter physics, with an emphasis on novel quantum phenomena emerging in low-dimensional materials.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
