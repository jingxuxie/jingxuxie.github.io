Advanced microelectronics in the future may require semiconducting channel materials beyond silicon. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, characterized by their atomically thin thickness, hold immense promise for high-performance electronic devices at the nanometer scale with lower heat dissipation. We present a new technique to utilize the novel spin-valley coupling in this system for the realization of the next-generation valleytronics.
