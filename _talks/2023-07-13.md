We propose to explore a novel hybrid heterostructure comprised of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, especially transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) coupled with lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs), and its integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. These systems will use the excellent light-absorbing properties of the TMDs to sensitize the narrow-bandwidth NIR emissions of the LnNPs [3,4]. Subsequent integration of these materials with CMOS technology will create a novel system for short-range data transmission and sensitive photodetection. Due to the ease of fabrication of these materials and the strong light-matter interactions in TMDs, these systems are expected to provide a low-cost and low-energy-consuming alternative to conventional technologies.
